# :ferris_wheel: All logos in one basket

`GitHub WARNING`: This is a __mirror repo__ from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/all-logos-in-one-basket). Please, send your MRs there. Issues can still be opened here and are welcome.

> This is a collection of Fediverse logos and other services one might find useful

#### [DEMO page](https://distributopia.gitlab.io/all-logos-in-one-basket)

## WHY
1. These icons live in different corners of the web. Having them grouped in one place is pretty handy
2. Some logos didn't initally have SVG variants. All SVG icons here are minified, all have same size and zero-based viewbox;
3. why not

> **Note:** work in progress
