# :ferris_wheel: All logos in one basket

`WARNING`: This is a __mirror repo__ from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/all-logos-in-one-basket). Please, open merge requests there.

> a collection of Fediverse logos one might find useful

#### [DEMO page](https://distributopia.gitlab.io/all-logos-in-one-basket)

## WHY

1. These icons live in different corners of the web. Having them grouped in one place is pretty handy
2. All SVG icons here are minified, all have same size and zero-based viewbox;

## Contributing

Please, add logos of fully open source software only :) Suggestions welcome in issues or via merge requests in the main [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/all-logos-in-one-basket) repo.
